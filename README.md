# Docker-Pyenv

### Install pyenv and two different Pythons in userspace

**Self validated?** not automated yet: run `py.test test_svb.py` after build

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) provides lightweight containers not quite like virtual machines using [Linux container technology (LXC)](https://linuxcontainers.org).

[Pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) builds different Python versions in Userspace and makes them easily manageable in combination with virtualenvs.

## TODO
use [docker bindings](http://docker-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/) to check result

## What is this?

This repository is part of the Self Validating Blueprint (SVB) project as introduced in [this blogpost](https://self-validating-blueprint.github.io/introduction/).
