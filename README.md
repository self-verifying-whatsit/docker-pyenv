[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) provides lightweight containers not quite like virtual machines using [Linux container technology (LXC)](https://linuxcontainers.org).

[Pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) builds different Python versions in Userspace and makes them easily manageable in combination with virtualenvs.

## TODO
